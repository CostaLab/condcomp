# _condcomp_: analysis of conditions in data

_condcomp_ is an R package which assists in the comparison of different conditions on a given clustered data. The comparison is performed on each cluster separately between each condcition. Several statistics are used and, when analysed in conjunction, they might give some insight regarding the heterogeneity of some of the clusters.

Please refer to the accompanying manuals and vignette for more information.

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from Github with [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

```r
devtools::install_github("CostaLab/condcomp")
