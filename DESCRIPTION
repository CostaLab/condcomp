Description: For a given clustered data, which can also be split
    into two conditions, this package provides a way to perform a
    condition comparison on said clustered data. The comparison is
    performed on each cluster. Several statistics are used and, when
    analysed in conjunction, they might give some insight regarding
    the heterogeneity of some of the clusters.
